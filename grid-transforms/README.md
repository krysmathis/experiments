# Grid-Transforms
An experiment in two parts
1. Setting up a tile type grid
1. Creating a flip effect with the grid

## The grid
I wanted to style a CSS grid with two different box sizes and use media queries to make them rearrange and resize

## CSS Transforms
Inspiration from: https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip
